2021 Revision of 2020 game code

This years robot was built off of our 2020 game year robot, and it features a quad mechanum-wheel drivetrain, as well as the turret and intake system we had in 2020.
This years robot was optimized for speed and manueverability, and we were able to achieve this due to some weight limit changes in the rulebook. We were
able to solve our issue with the robot being too top heavy, as well as get a working mechanum wheel drivetrain.

The code features multiple tweaks to driving, as well as a less than working macro controller. This year was largly experemental.
